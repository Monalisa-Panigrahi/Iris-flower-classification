# Iris-flower-classification
An Iris flower classification project in machine learning involves building a model that can accurately classify iris flowers into different species based on their features. Below is a step-by-step guide for implementing an Iris flower classification project using Python and scikit-learn:
# Import Libraries:
I have used Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn to import necessary tools.
# Dataset:
I have gathered a dataset containing information about features , petals length . I included the MovieLens dataset available in kaggle .
# Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data. Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and format the data in a way suitable for machine learning.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the characteristics of your dataset through exploratory data analysis. Visualize trends, distributions, and correlations to gain insights.
# Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features from the dataset that can help in understanding user preferences and the features of the flower .
# Model Selection:
I have included collaborative filtering .
# Evaluation:
I have evaluated my model using the testing dataset. Common metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) .
# Deployment:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for making real-time recommendations. This could be integrated into a web application, mobile app, or any other platform.
# Example Tools and Libraries:
Python: pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
Collaborative Filtering: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
